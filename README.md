# Aggregating data science events into 1 calendar

In this project I aggregate all data science related events in the Netherlands.

This project should run every day to get the latest events, aggregate them all into one calendar feed and publish the latest version.

## FAQ
- I want to add a data science meetup to this calendar

Make sure you publish valid ical format files and add the link to [calendars.csv](calendars.csv).

Output for now is published to [raw github ds_events.ics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMHogervorst/ds_calendar/main/ds_events.ics)
