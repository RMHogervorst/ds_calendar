SUMMARY:ECDA Leadership Challenge with Data Analytics | Regular Track
DESCRIPTION:Artificial Intelligence will without any doubt change the way we will do business in the future. As a matter of fact\, it is already changing many businesses that we are involved in today. But what is needed to make Artificial Intelligence a valuable part of the way we do business ourselves? Many experts believe that successful Artificial Intelligence applications hinge on the so-called b-smact technologies (Blockchain\, Social media\, Mobile use\, Analytics\, Cloud and Things-on-the-internet or better known as IoT). The fueling component of those technologies is Big Data. This insight will require a whole new set of business skills. Understanding and working with new technologies for big data collection\, analysis and prediction will not create only huge opportunities for business\, but also ethical\, legal\, privacy and technical issues concerning every part of the organization. It will influence customer relationships\, redefine how firms develop new products and services\, change how operations are organized and managed\, improve demand and supply networks\, and provide the basis for new business models. It will demand a data-driven focus of everyone involved \n\n\n\nThis training programme combines the science of business\, data and societal perspectives. Participants ‚Äì who usually join with a company team of 3 to 5 persons ‚Äì acquire a broad knowledge and diverse skills related to data analytics which may lead to new insights that drive new value creation opportunities. Such learning by doing manifests itself along two dimensions: across multiple levels (individual\, group\, and corporate) and across multiple functions.

SUMMARY:Grip on AI: How mature is your organization?
DESCRIPTION:Within this exploration\, we investigate how an AI ethics maturity model can help you gain a grip on AI and ethics within your organization. How is your institution doing when it comes to awareness and culture\, proper AI governance\, and more. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nüìÖ March 21\, 2024‚è∞ 14:30 ‚Äì 16:00üìç Online \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPilot\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSURF will facilitate a guided ‚Äòpilot‚Äô with this maturity model during 2024\, in which we want to explore how tools such as these can contribute to the responsible use of AI within the sector. We organize this in collaboration with EDSA and Erasmus Center for Data Analytics (ECDA). We hope to do an informal ‚Äòself-assessment‚Äô with a diverse group of institutions\, to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt\, and to learn from each other. \n\n\n\nProgram\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKick-off: we introduce the maturity model and the exploration\, will you join us?¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation session for participants: we will discuss further about how you can best approach this. And we make agreements about the mutual exchange of information. This meeting will take place on April 2 from 10 am to 11 am via Teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-assessment: you work within your institution to do a self-assessment¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback: we discuss the results and experiences with each other. And we will discuss possible next steps.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFor whom?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe pilot exploration of the maturity model for AI ethics is aimed at institutional staff who are involved in the governance of new technologies and applications within the institution. And is therefore interesting for information managers\, privacy officers\, data protection officers\, enterprise architects\, and policy officers. \n\n\n\nDay Program\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIntroduction & general Responsible AI at SURF (10 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãethics maturity model (15 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing experiences through the AI@EUR program (15 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion & questions (20 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak (5 min)?¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the pilot (15 min)¬†¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion and questions (10 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRegister
