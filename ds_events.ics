SUMMARY:ECDA Leadership Challenge with Data Analytics | Education Track (Fall 2023 Edition)
DESCRIPTION:The use of data and application of analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) will without any doubtchange the way we design and operate our Higher Education. As a matter of fact\, today it is alreadychanging our educational institutions. But what is needed to make analytics and AI valuable partsof the way we organize our education? Many experts believe that successful transformation of ourHigher Education hinges on five pillars: strategy\, hr and culture\, organisation\, governance andcompliance\, ICT.This insight will require a whole new set of skills and ways of working. Understanding and workingwith new technologies for (big) data collection\, analysis and prediction will not create only hugeopportunities\, but also ethical\, legal\, privacy and technical issues concerning every part of theorganization. It will influence the relationship with our students\, redefines how new programs andservices are developed\, changes how operations are managed\, and provides the basis for newservice offerings. It will demand a data driven focus of everyone involved in the organization.This training programme combines the science of business\, data\, and societal perspectives.Participants – who usually join with a team of 3 to 5 persons – acquire a broad knowledge and diverseskills related to data analytics\, which may lead to new insights that drive new value creationopportunities in the context of higher education. Such learning by doing manifests itself along twodimensions: across multiple levels (individual\, group) and across multiple functions

SUMMARY:Empowering a Sustainable Future
DESCRIPTION:In the fall of 2022\, we had the ambitious idea to develop a new form of behavioral interventions. By combining our expertise in behavioral science and machine learning\, we set out to develop an approach that personalizes behavior interventions based on the motives and behaviors of individual consumers. An integral part of our research agenda is a new research platform on which we can run behavioral experiments around intervention personalization.  \n\n\n\nAt the same time\, we wanted to make the research itself sustainable: (1) promote sustainable development goals\, (2) partner with companies and institutions that promote sustainable developments\, and (3) promote open science by publishing our data and code generated through our platform.  \n\n\n\nAfter less than twelve months\, our project is in full swing! We were awarded a Kickstarter Convergence grant\, received a Veni grant\, and won an honorable mention at the EMAC–Sheth Foundation Sustainability Research Competition. Most importantly\, we have gained the generous support of fantastic sponsors\, and we have developed a prototype for our field experiment app.  \n\n\n\nWe want to celebrate these developments and to bring all project partners and researchers together\, at our Empowering a Sustainable Future conference.  \n\n\n\nWhen and Where?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNovember 9th from 15:00 to 18:00   \n\n\n\nPolak building\, Erasmus University Rotterdam\, Campus Woudenstein  \n\n\n\nPerfectly in line with our project\, we are delighted that Eric van Heck will inspire us with his thoughts on using algorithms for circular business models.  \n\n\n\nConference Agenda\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n15:00-15:15: Walk in and Registration \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n15:15-15:35 Project presentation – Sebastian Gabel & Antonia Krefeld–Schwalb \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n15:35-16:05 Networking session 1: Meet research experts. \n\n\n\nDuring this half an hour\, you can ask in depth questions to our sustainability researchers. Two tables will be formed where you can ask direct questions to both Antonia and Sebastian. Sebastian can give you more information on how machine learning is integrated into the research; Antonia can give you a deep dive on the psychological and behavioral aspects of the project.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n16:05-16:35 Keynote Speech – Eric van Heck: Five Ways to Improve Your Algorithms for Circular Business \n\n\n\nAbstract  \n\n\n\nAlgorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) combined with Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Blockchain (BC) technologies will create new opportunities for sustainable and circular business models. Instead of the ‘take\, make\, and dispose’ attitude of traditional and linear business\, circular business will be able to create social\, economic\, and ecological value by combining less consumption (refuse\, rethink\, and reduce) with smart production (re-use\, repair\, refurbish\, remanufacture\, repurpose\, recycling\, and recover) of products and services and with partners and customers in a circular and digital business ecosystem. This keynote will discuss and illustrate algorithms for circular business and its five key design challenges.   \n\n\n\nSpeaker  \n\n\n\nEric van Heck is Professor of Information and Markets at Rotterdam School of Management\, Erasmus University. His research in the flower sector was awarded with the ERIM Book Award\, for the book Making Markets\, and the AIS Impact Award and INFORMS ISS Design Award for research to make the flower sector more sustainable. He is author of Technology Meets Flowers. Unlocking the Circular and Digital Economy (Springer Nature\, 2021); translated in Dutch as Technologie en Tulpen. Circulaire en digitale innovatie in de bloemensector (Mediawerf\, 2002). The Dutch translation is longlisted for the Management Book of 2023.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Eric van Heck Professor of Information Management and Markets Rotterdam School of Management  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n16:35-17:05 Networking session 2: Meet sustainability heroes. \n\n\n\nInterested sponsors will each be given a few minutes to talk about their company vision\, mission\, and products\, and to discuss the interesting questions and challenges they have encountered during their business ventures.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n17:05-18:00 Closing drinks and snacks  \n\n\n\nQuestions?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis event promises to be a great opportunity for all existing and potential partners\, including you\, to come together\, forge meaningful connections with business and research partners\, and learn more about our project and the progress we made.  \n\n\n\nIf you have questions\, please contact us at sutainability@rsm.nl!  \n\n\n\nWe are very looking forward to discussing our project and your efforts for a sustainable future with you\, and to celebrate what we have accomplished already 🎉  \n\n\n\nSee you at Erasmus in November!  \n\n\n\nAntonia & Sebastian  \n\n\n\nPowered by the Smart Campus Project

SUMMARY:ECDA Leadership Challenge with Data Analytics | Regular Track
DESCRIPTION:Artificial Intelligence will without any doubt change the way we will do business in the future. As a matter of fact\, it is already changing many businesses that we are involved in today. But what is needed to make Artificial Intelligence a valuable part of the way we do business ourselves? Many experts believe that successful Artificial Intelligence applications hinge on the so-called b-smact technologies (Blockchain\, Social media\, Mobile use\, Analytics\, Cloud and Things-on-the-internet or better known as IoT). The fueling component of those technologies is Big Data. This insight will require a whole new set of business skills. Understanding and working with new technologies for big data collection\, analysis and prediction will not create only huge opportunities for business\, but also ethical\, legal\, privacy and technical issues concerning every part of the organization. It will influence customer relationships\, redefine how firms develop new products and services\, change how operations are organized and managed\, improve demand and supply networks\, and provide the basis for new business models. It will demand a data-driven focus of everyone involved \n\n\n\nThis training programme combines the science of business\, data and societal perspectives. Participants – who usually join with a company team of 3 to 5 persons – acquire a broad knowledge and diverse skills related to data analytics which may lead to new insights that drive new value creation opportunities. Such learning by doing manifests itself along two dimensions: across multiple levels (individual\, group\, and corporate) and across multiple functions.
