SUMMARY:Erasmus Thesis Awards: Impactful Data Analytics
DESCRIPTION:Are you ready to write your thesis? Do you need some inspiration from former students from your very own master program\, or want to meet data-experts from the field?  \n\n\n\nOn the 26th of January\, we will host the Erasmus Thesis Awards: Impactful Data Analytics\, organized by MAEUR and Erasmus Centre of Data Analytics! During this award ceremony\, the top students from four data-oriented master programs will present their thesis to a team of judges which consists of data-experts from the field. The winning thesis will be rewarded with a cheque by the Erasmus Centre of Data Analytics (ECDA)!  \n\n\n\nWe believe that data and AI are changemakers to create social impact. Therefore\, we want to showcase the EUR talent in data analytics and AI\, to inspire the new generation of thesis writing students\, showcase what the possibilities are for their own thesis\, and for career journeys afterwards. \n\n\n\nThe nominated theses that will be presented come from the following master programs:  \n\n\n\n\nBusiness Information Management (RSM)\n\n\n\nBusiness Analytics Management (RSM)\n\n\n\nData Science and Marketing Analytics (ESE)\n\n\n\nEconometrics (ESE) \n\n\n\n\nThe judges\, which are data-experts from various companies\, will be present during the networking drinks afterwards. Next to getting some inspiration for your thesis\, this will also give you the opportunity to meet your potential future employer.

SUMMARY:ECDA Leadership Challenge with Data Analytics | Regular Track (Spring 2023 Edition)
DESCRIPTION:Artificial Intelligence will without any doubt change the way we will do business in the future. As a matter of fact\, it is already changing many businesses that we are involved in today. But what is needed to make Artificial Intelligence a valuable part of the way we do business ourselves? Many experts believe that successful Artificial Intelligence applications hinge on the so-called b-smact technologies (Blockchain\, Social media\, Mobile use\, Analytics\, Cloud and Things-on-the-internet or better known as IoT). The fueling component of those technologies is Big Data. This insight will require a whole new set of business skills. Understanding and working with new technologies for big data collection\, analysis and prediction will not create only huge opportunities for business\, but also ethical\, legal\, privacy and technical issues concerning every part of the organization. It will influence customer relationships\, redefine how firms develop new products and services\, change how operations are organized and managed\, improve demand and supply networks\, and provide the basis for new business models. It will demand a data-driven focus of everyone involved \n\n\n\nThis training programme combines the science of business\, data and societal perspectives. Participants – who usually join with a company team of 3 to 5 persons – acquire a broad knowledge and diverse skills related to data analytics which may lead to new insights that drive new value creation opportunities. Such learning by doing manifests itself along two dimensions: across multiple levels (individual\, group\, and corporate) and across multiple functions.
