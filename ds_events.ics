Many experts believe that successful transformation of ourHigher Education hinges on five pillars: strategy\, hr and culture\, organisation\, governance andcompliance\, ICT.This insight will require a whole new set of skills and ways of working. Understanding and workingwith new technologies for (big) data collection\, analysis and prediction will not create only hugeopportunities\, but also ethical\, legal\, privacy and technical issues concerning every part of theorganization. It will influence the relationship with our students\, redefines how new programs andservices are developed\, changes how operations are managed\, and provides the basis for newservice offerings.
