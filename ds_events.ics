SUMMARY:ECDA Leadership Challenge with Data Analytics | Regular Track
DESCRIPTION:Artificial Intelligence will without any doubt change the way we will do business in the future. As a matter of fact\, it is already changing many businesses that we are involved in today. But what is needed to make Artificial Intelligence a valuable part of the way we do business ourselves? Many experts believe that successful Artificial Intelligence applications hinge on the so-called b-smact technologies (Blockchain\, Social media\, Mobile use\, Analytics\, Cloud and Things-on-the-internet or better known as IoT). The fueling component of those technologies is Big Data. This insight will require a whole new set of business skills. Understanding and working with new technologies for big data collection\, analysis and prediction will not create only huge opportunities for business\, but also ethical\, legal\, privacy and technical issues concerning every part of the organization. It will influence customer relationships\, redefine how firms develop new products and services\, change how operations are organized and managed\, improve demand and supply networks\, and provide the basis for new business models. It will demand a data-driven focus of everyone involved \n\n\n\nThis training programme combines the science of business\, data and societal perspectives. Participants ‚Äì who usually join with a company team of 3 to 5 persons ‚Äì acquire a broad knowledge and diverse skills related to data analytics which may lead to new insights that drive new value creation opportunities. Such learning by doing manifests itself along two dimensions: across multiple levels (individual\, group\, and corporate) and across multiple functions.

SUMMARY:Grip on AI: How mature is your organization?
DESCRIPTION:Within this exploration\, we investigate how an AI ethics maturity model can help you gain a grip on AI and ethics within your organization. How is your institution doing when it comes to awareness and culture\, proper AI governance\, and more. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nüìÖ March 21\, 2024‚è∞ 14:30 ‚Äì 16:00üìç Online \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPilot\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSURF will facilitate a guided ‚Äòpilot‚Äô with this maturity model during 2024\, in which we want to explore how tools such as these can contribute to the responsible use of AI within the sector. We organize this in collaboration with EDSA and Erasmus Center for Data Analytics (ECDA). We hope to do an informal ‚Äòself-assessment‚Äô with a diverse group of institutions\, to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt\, and to learn from each other. \n\n\n\nProgram\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKick-off: we introduce the maturity model and the exploration\, will you join us?¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation session for participants: we will discuss further about how you can best approach this. And we make agreements about the mutual exchange of information. This meeting will take place on April 2 from 10 am to 11 am via Teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-assessment: you work within your institution to do a self-assessment¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback: we discuss the results and experiences with each other. And we will discuss possible next steps.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFor whom?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe pilot exploration of the maturity model for AI ethics is aimed at institutional staff who are involved in the governance of new technologies and applications within the institution. And is therefore interesting for information managers\, privacy officers\, data protection officers\, enterprise architects\, and policy officers. \n\n\n\nDay Program\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIntroduction & general Responsible AI at SURF (10 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãethics maturity model (15 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing experiences through the AI@EUR program (15 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion & questions (20 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak (5 min)?¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the pilot (15 min)¬†¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion and questions (10 min)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRegister

SUMMARY:Erasmus Data Summit
DESCRIPTION:The event is hosted by the Erasmus Center for Data Analytics; the center of expertise and community of Erasmus University Rotterdam around data\, digitization\, AI & Immersive tech\, and the Erasmus X Center for Experimentation in Education. We support the strategy of Erasmus University Rotterdam: Creating Positive Societal Impact. In this\, Data\, AI & Immersive tech are seen as important drivers to create direct social impact. Where people and the use and acceptance of this technology are central\, not just the technology. \n\n\n\nBy bridging the gap between technical knowledge (Delft) and knowledge from the business and social domain (Rotterdam)\, we want to help data tech entrepreneurs\, government and business representatives\, universities\, and students who work with AI & Immersive tech to set up companies and grow themselves and their organizations to focus on the societal challenges of tomorrow. \n\n\n\nSummit \n\n\n\nDuring the summit\, there will be renounced speakers and representatives from the data tech ecosystem (both new talent and established entrepreneurs\, representatives from government and industry\, universities (EUR\, TU Delft/convergence community)\, and various students\, to celebrate data\, AI and Immersive tech\, meet new talent\, connect with established alumni and discuss key societal themes around data and innovation. This edition will be focused on Creating the Future Workforce. Looking at the immense impact that AI has on our workplace\, work\, and way of learning\, we need to keep up with the changes and prepare for what is to come. You can check out last year‚Äôs speakers via this link. \n\n\n\nThe meeting is in the form of a dynamic show format\, chaired by a top host (Jim Stolze)\, where various guests will speak per topic. Therefore\, if the event‚Äôs period does not suit\, attendance for 1 specific part may also be an option. \n\n\n\nThere are video pitches\, talks\, shoutouts\, and conversations with (alumni) representatives and entrepreneurs around the following themes: future of work\, human perspective on working with AI\, Work and Talent\, AI & Education. We also want to answer questions about AI & equality\, ethics\, and immersive healthcare. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Erasmus Data Summit will be held on the 18th of April\, starting from 13:30 (walk-in from 13:00). Together with renowned speakers from academia and industry\, we will discuss the following questions: \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow are generative AI and Immersive tech evolving in the coming years?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhat is the impact on work ‚Äì how are they changing the way we work\, educate\, skill\, learn\, or do research? How does it impact equality\, opportunity creation\, innovation\, safety\, security\, healthcare\, and well-being?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow does this affect our leadership needs and the workability of employees?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow does it shape our beliefs? How can we stop misuse? How can we strive towards transparent\, ethical & trustworthy generative AI?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow can we make use of these diverse technologies (or platforms) well to prepare ourselves and future generations to tackle societal and organizational challenges? (AI\, haptics\, gamification\, VR\, AR\, XR\, metaverse\, web3)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nShow inspiring use cases in business\, education\, innovation\, and healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow can we ensure enough education and talent in data\, AI & Immersive tech? How can we make our talent data and AI literate to foster responsible use of immersive technologies?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAfter the plenary part\, an Immersive Tech Fair will be hosted in the Theil Building. Here we offer our guests the possibility to have a hands-on experience with the latest tech\, and network\, and have drinks. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nExternal guests are welcome to park in the main parking lot right under the campus
