SUMMARY:11th Rotterdam Data Science Meetup - Applied Data Science in Person
DESCRIPTION:Details\n\n\n\nHello AI and DS enthusiasts!We would like to invite you to our 11th DS Rotterdam Meetup on Applied Data Science. We are excited to open the doors and gather again in person.Please RSVP belowWhere: ECDA (Polack building)\, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50\, 3062 PA Rotterdam\, The NetherlandsNote that we have a limited number of spots available. So\, if you can no longer make it\, please let us know as soon as possible – that way we can assign your seat to someone on the waiting list.PROGRAM17:30 – 17:40: Intro by your hosts17:40 – 18:00: Talk 118:00 – 18:20: Talk 218:20 – 18:30: Closing remarks18:30 – 20:30: Networking with food and drinks \n\n\n\nTALKSTalk 1: Erasmus Q-Intelligence | Dr. Koen Bel | Demand forecasting for Fast Moving Consumer GoodsAbstract : Accurate demand forecasts lead to better understanding of demand\, better storage positions\, less wastage and higher profit. In this talk\, we dive into the techniques behind demand forecasting\, how to explain and handle uncertainty in a real-time application and how to utilize the information from a demand forecasting tool. We focus both on econometric theory and real-life application. How can data science be implemented and have impact in daily practice? \n\n\n\nBio: Koen is data scientist at Erasmus Q-Intelligence. With his background as econometrician\, he applies techniques such as random forest\, GLM\, conjoint analysis and more to topics like demand forecasting\, marketing and HR analytics. He combines academic knowledge with practical implementation to get the most out of data analytics. \n\n\n\nTalk 2: Atos | Bram Miedema & Sébastien Naus | Design and productization of NLP- solution \n\n\n\nAbstract : Atos is handling a large project at a manufacturer of aircraft parts in Denmark. This project automates the processing of Requests for Quotations coming from customers around the world. These requests come via different channels and in free text form. Atos has developed a cloud-native serverless application and a suite of Machine Learning models that automate the end-to-end RFQ flow using Natural Language Understanding. The business context and functional flow of the solution will be introduced before putting an emphasis on the Machine Learning models created and their operationalization using fully-automated MLOps pipelines. \n\n\n\nBio: Bram Miedema designs and matures data driven solutions for several delivery projects and customers within Atos. He has been part of the team since the start of the project and saw through to make the total system is designed to meet industry standards\, maturing it\, and keeping it maintainable. Bram has a background in Bioinformatics. From the start of his career Bram worked on the many aspects of making AI model adaptation more easy\, robust\, and maintainable towards the future.Sébastien Naus is the solution lead and Machine Learning engineer on the project. He has a broad interest in all aspects of data science and machine learning with a specific emphasis on the operationalisation of ML models (MLOps). Sébastien has a background in Engineering Physics with a speciality in semiconductor electronics. He started his career as a consultant in the telecoms sector before moving towards data science. For the past 4 years\, he has worked at Atos as a data science consultant\, delivering data solutions to large companies across Northern Europe.

SUMMARY:Erasmus Thesis Awards: Impactful Data Analytics
DESCRIPTION:Are you ready to write your thesis? Do you need some inspiration from former students from your very own master program\, or want to meet data-experts from the field?  \n\n\n\nOn the 26th of January\, we will host the Erasmus Thesis Awards: Impactful Data Analytics\, organized by MAEUR and Erasmus Centre of Data Analytics! During this award ceremony\, the top students from four data-oriented master programs will present their thesis to a team of judges which consists of data-experts from the field. The winning thesis will be rewarded with a cheque by the Erasmus Centre of Data Analytics (ECDA)!  \n\n\n\nWe believe that data and AI are changemakers to create social impact. Therefore\, we want to showcase the EUR talent in data analytics and AI\, to inspire the new generation of thesis writing students\, showcase what the possibilities are for their own thesis\, and for career journeys afterwards. \n\n\n\nThe nominated theses that will be presented come from the following master programs:  \n\n\n\n\nBusiness Information Management (RSM)\n\n\n\nBusiness Analytics Management (RSM)\n\n\n\nData Science and Marketing Analytics (ESE)\n\n\n\nEconometrics (ESE) \n\n\n\n\nThe judges\, which are data-experts from various companies\, will be present during the networking drinks afterwards. Next to getting some inspiration for your thesis\, this will also give you the opportunity to meet your potential future employer.

SUMMARY:ECDA Leadership Challenge with Data Analytics | Regular Track (Spring 2023 Edition)
DESCRIPTION:Artificial Intelligence will without any doubt change the way we will do business in the future. As a matter of fact\, it is already changing many businesses that we are involved in today. But what is needed to make Artificial Intelligence a valuable part of the way we do business ourselves? Many experts believe that successful Artificial Intelligence applications hinge on the so-called b-smact technologies (Blockchain\, Social media\, Mobile use\, Analytics\, Cloud and Things-on-the-internet or better known as IoT). The fueling component of those technologies is Big Data. This insight will require a whole new set of business skills. Understanding and working with new technologies for big data collection\, analysis and prediction will not create only huge opportunities for business\, but also ethical\, legal\, privacy and technical issues concerning every part of the organization. It will influence customer relationships\, redefine how firms develop new products and services\, change how operations are organized and managed\, improve demand and supply networks\, and provide the basis for new business models. It will demand a data-driven focus of everyone involved \n\n\n\nThis training programme combines the science of business\, data and societal perspectives. Participants – who usually join with a company team of 3 to 5 persons – acquire a broad knowledge and diverse skills related to data analytics which may lead to new insights that drive new value creation opportunities. Such learning by doing manifests itself along two dimensions: across multiple levels (individual\, group\, and corporate) and across multiple functions.
